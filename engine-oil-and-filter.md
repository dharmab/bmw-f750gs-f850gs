## Checking Oil Level

1. Raise bike on center stand
1. Allow engine to idle until cooling fan starts, then wait 1 minute and turn
   off engine
1. Wait 1 minute
1. Remove and wipe oil dipstick
1. Insert oil dipstick without screwing it in, rotating it once (opposite the
   threads) to coat both sides of the stick
1. Remove oil dipstick and read oil level

The difference between the MIN and MAX markings on the dipstick is 0.5 liters.

## Changing Oil and Filter

1. Recommended: Bring engine to operating temperature, then wait for engine to
   partially cool down. This will help the old oil flow out more quickly.
1. Remove skid plate (if installed)
1. Using T-50 socket, remove drain bolt for lower sump (refer to part labeled 3
   in diagram)
1. Recommended: Place aluminum foil under and around oil filter to funnel oil
   away from the exhaust and brake pedal
1. Remove oil filter
1. Wait for oil to stop draining from lower sump
1. Use 5mm hex socket or Allen key to remove drain bolt for upper
   sump (refer to part labeled 11 in diagram)
1. Wait for oil to stop draining from upper sump
1. Replace 5mm drain bolt and T-50 drain bolt, using new crush
   washer
1. Use some of the old oil to lubricate the seal on the new oil filter.
1. Install new filter _carefully_. The location of the filter will require
   installation using an oil filter wrench. However, care must be taken not to
over-tighten the filter, or the seal will be damaged and cause an oil leak. The
ADVRider forums report this mistake being made by professional BMW techs at BMW
dealerships! Tighten the filter no tighter than you would tighten by hand.
1. Fill with oil. Recommended: Initially fill with only 2.7 liters to avoid
   overfilling, and add the remaining as needed after checking the level.
1. Bring the engine to operating temperature and check the oil level. Add or
   remove oil as needed to bring oil level within spec.
1. Reinstall skid plate (if present)
