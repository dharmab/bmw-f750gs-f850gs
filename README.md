This repository contains my notes on the BMW F750GS and F850GS series of
motorcycles.

## Overview

The BMW F750GS/F850GS is a middleweight adventure motorcycle. The bike is a
consummate all-rounder and is a good choice for commuting in all weather
conditions, riding on twisty roads, touring long distances on the highway and
going on dirt and gravel roads and down many trails.

The bikes are characterized by their 853cc parallel twin engine, linear
powerband, suite of electronic rider aids and their accessibility to less
experienced and shorter riders.

## Contact

I have omitted some advanced procedures such as valve adjustment and fork oil service. They differ significantly between the F750GS and F850GS and transcribing them would be tediuous and error prone. If you need technical info on these services, contact me for information. You can find my contact info [on my website](https://dharmab.com).
