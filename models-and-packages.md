# Models and Packages

There are three models of the F750GS/F850GS:

- The **F750GS**, which is slightly less powerful and is more focused on
  on-road riding
- The **F850GS**, which is slightly more powerful and is more focused on
  off-road riding
- The **F850GS Adventure** (aka the GSA), which is an even more off-road
  focused F850GS

All versions of the bike share the same frame and the same 853cc engine.  Many
of the parts are the same across the models as well.

In addition, there were two option packages available in the US as of 2019:

- Select
- Premium

As of 2019, virtually all bikes imported into the US were equipped with the
Premium package due to high demand for the optional features.

## Changes by Model Year

- 2021: Update for Euro5 emissions compliance. Exhaust headers are slightly
  larger, which impacts the design of some aftermarket skid plates. Engine
  cold start cycle tweaked so that bike now idles high after cold start to
  heat the catalytic converter.

## Models

### F750GS

- A different camshaft, intake and engine map are used from the F850GS. This
  lowers power to 77hp/61ft-lb. 
    - Recommended fuel octane is 91 RON/87 AKI (Regular) 
- Cast aluminum alloy wheels are equipped with a 19-inch front wheel diameter.
  This improves on-road handling at the expense of off-road obstacle clearance
and durability.
- The front suspension is a conventional (right-side up) 41mm fork with 5.9
  inches of travel.
- The rear suspension is a conventional spring strut with 6.9 inches of travel.
- Due to the lower suspension, seat height is 0.2 inches lower on the F750GS.
- Total ground clearance is 7.5 inches.
- Wet weight is 493lbs.

### F850GS

- The F850GS outputs 90hp/63ft-lb.
    - Recommended fuel octane is 95 RON/90 AKI (Premium) 
- Spoked wheels are used with a 21-inch front wheel diameter. This improves
  off-road obstacle clearance and durability and provides a wider range of
off-road tire choices.
- The front suspension is an inverted (upside-down) 43mm fork with 8.0 inches
  of travel.
- The rear suspension is a progressive-damping spring strut with 8.6 inches of
  travel.
- Total ground clearance is 9.8 inches.
- Wet weight is 504lbs.
