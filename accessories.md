## Brake Pedal

A dual-height brake pedal raises the pedal height, making it easier to use the
rear brake while standing.

- [AltRider DualControl Brake System](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-dualcontrol-brake-system-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2733)
- The F850GSA OEM brake pedal is dual-height, and could possibly be adapted to
the F750GS and F850GS

## Center Stand

A center stand is included with most bikes from the factory. However, if the
suspension lowering option is selected then the center stand is removed to
compensate for ground clearance.

- [SW-MOTECH Centerstand](https://sw-motech.com/en/products/safety/stands/centerstand/4052572056677.htm)

## Engine Bars

Engine bars protect the engine from damage in a crash or tip-over.

## Footpegs

Aftermarket footpegs can provide better grip and comfort when riding off-road.

- [PivotPegz Mark 3](https://pivotpegz.com/collections/bmw/products/bmw-2017-2018-f750gs-f850gs)
- [Touratech Works (Low Version)](https://touratech-usa.com/Store/Touratech-Works-Footpegs-Low-Version-Most-BMW-GS-Models)

## Handguards

Handguards provide wind deflection for road riding and protect the rider's
hands when riding off-road.

- [Barkbusters Variable Protection
  System](https://barkbusters.net/products/vps/) Note: BEWARE that the metal
guard interferes with the TFT display at certain angles. In a crash or
tip-over, there is a risk that the guard could rotate and impact the TFT
display.
- The F850GSA comes equipped with handguards which are suitable for wind
  deflection and minor obstacles when riding off-road, but are made of plastic
instead of metal and not suitable for hard knocks.

## Headlight Guard

A headlight guard prevents a rock from smashing your expensive LED headlight (a
real risk when following other vehicles off-road)

- [Puig Headlight Protector](https://puig.tv/en/tuning-motos/headlight-protector/headlight-protector?bike=23755)
- [AltRider Stainless Steel Mesh Headlight Guard](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-stainless-steel-mesh-headlight-guard-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2747/cid/2)

## Luggage

### Hard Luggage

Hard luggage is an excellent option for street riding and for parking in places
where locking luggage is required. However, there is a risk of catching a leg
between the luggage and the ground or bike in a crash.

#### Vario Cases

The official Vario cases are plastic cases which can be expanded and shrunk
using an internal lever. This is particularly useful for urban environments-
the side cases can be kept shrunk while riding to enable lane splitting, and
then expanded while parked to accommodate a helmet and riding gear. The cases
can also be coded to use the key on the keyless ignition fob.

The Vario side case mounts are integrated into the bike's tail section, so no
additional racks are required. This keeps the streamlined look of the bike when
the cases are not mounted.

A drawback of the Vario side cases is that they are side-loading instead of
top-loading. This is slightly less convenient to pack and unpack.

- [Vario top case](https://www.bmw-motorrad-bohling.com/bmw-variotopcase-set-f750gs-2017-2019-f850gs-2017-2019-keyless-ride.html)

#### Aftermarket

Various aftermarket luggage systems are available:

- [Jesse Luggage](https://www.jesseluggage.com/product-category/bmw/bmw-f750gs-f850gs/)
- [SW-MOTECH](https://sw-motech.com/en/products/luggage/side+cases/)
- [TouraTech](https://touratech-usa.com/Motorcycle-Panniers-and-Luggage?a=907)

### Soft Luggage

Soft luggage is an excellent option for off-road riding. The soft material is
unlikely to contribute to injuries in a crash and can pad the bike in a
tip-over.

Various systems are available:

- [Dryspec](https://dryspec.com)
- [Kriega](https://kriega.us/usdrypacks)
- [Mosko Moto](https://moskomoto.com/collections/motorcycle-luggage)
- [Wolfman](https://wolfmanluggage.com/)

### Improvised Luggage

[ROK Straps](http://rokstrapamerica.com/) can be used to strap duffel bags,
drypacks, backpacks and other generic luggage to the tail rack. This can be an
excellent budget option- I find that two ROK straps and a [Sea to
Summit](https://seatosummitusa.com/) or [Skog Å
Kust](https://www.skogakust.com/) drypack make an effective luggage option for
well under $80.

## Sidestand/Kickstand Foot

A sidestand foot spreads the weight of the bike over a larger area than the OEM
sidestand, which prevents the bike from sinking into soft ground when parked.

- A crushed soda can or hockey puck makes an excellent sidestand foot.
- [Revzilla sells sidestand feet for as low as $5](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle-side-stand-feet)
- [Metal sidestand feet are available on AliExpress for under $10](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32999761042.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.23571245zq4B9v&algo_pvid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c&algo_expid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c-0&btsid=9f609285-a54c-4144-8e96-ee70966496e3&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4,searchweb201603_52)
- In a pinch, put a flat rock under your sidestand to spread the weight out.

## Seat

- OEM low and comfort seats are available
- [Sargent has multiple seats available](https://www.sargentcycle.com/Seats-Accessories/Sargent-Seats-BMW-F750-850GS/)

## Skid Plate

A skid plate protects the underside of the bike from rocks and debris, and can
be used to slide the bike over obstacles such as tree trunks.

- [Black Dog Cycle Works Ultimate Skid Plate](https://blackdogcw.com/bdcw-ultimate-skid-plate-bmw-f850gsa-f850gs-f750gs/)

## Windshield

A wind deflector such as a [Givi Shield+]
(http://giviusa.com/givi-products/accessories/s180t-universal-deflector-clear-detail)
can add a bit of height and adjustability to the OEM windshield. Riders of 
average height may find that this aims turbulent air at the middle of their
face.

[MADSTAD](https://madstad.com/collections/bmw/products/bmw-f750-850gs-2018) has
different sizes of windshield available for a range of rider heights.
