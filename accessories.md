## Brake Pedal

A dual-height brake pedal raises the pedal height, making it easier to use the
rear brake while standing.

- The F850GSA OEM brake pedal is dual-height, and can be installed on a
  non-Adventure F750GS or F850GS
- [AltRider DualControl Brake System](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-dualcontrol-brake-system-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2733)

## Center Stand

A center stand is included with most bikes from the factory. However, if the
suspension lowering option is selected then the center stand is removed to
compensate for ground clearance.

- [SW-MOTECH Centerstand](https://sw-motech.com/en/products/safety/stands/centerstand/4052572056677.htm)

## Engine Bars

Engine bars protect the engine from damage in a crash or tip-over.

- [AltRider Lower Crash Bars](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-lower-crash-bars-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2728/cid/3)
- [GIVI TN5127 Engine Guards](http://giviusa.com/my-motorcycle/bmw/f850gs-19/tn5127-engine-guards-detail)
- [Hepco-Becker Engine Bars](https://blackdogcw.com/hepco-becker-engine-bars-bmw-f750-850gs-2019/)

- [Touratech Engine Crash Bars](https://touratech-usa.com/store/Engine-Crash-Bars-BMW-F850GS-F750GS)

## Footpegs

Aftermarket footpegs can provide better grip and comfort when riding off-road.

- [PivotPegz Mark 3](https://pivotpegz.com/collections/bmw/products/bmw-2017-2018-f750gs-f850gs)
- [Touratech Works (Low Version)](https://touratech-usa.com/Store/Touratech-Works-Footpegs-Low-Version-Most-BMW-GS-Models)

## GPS

BMW Navigator GPS units (made by Garmin) mount into the OEM GPS mount and
integrate with the bike. The GPS will automatically turn on and off with the
bike's ignition system and can be controlled with the menu navigation controls
on the left handlebar.

[A phone mount adapter for the OEM GPS mount is
available](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32963526981.html). Note that phones
with image stabilized cameras can be damaged by vibration when mounted to a
motorcycle!

## Handguards

Handguards provide wind deflection for road riding and protect the rider's
hands when riding off-road.

- [Barkbusters Variable Protection
System](https://barkbusters.net/products/vps/) Note: The metal guard
interferes with the TFT display at certain angles. In a crash or
tip-over, there is a risk that the guard could rotate and impact the TFT
display. Always test the lock-to-lock steering range after installing
the handguards or after a hard knock or drop.
- The F850GSA comes equipped with handguards which are suitable for wind
deflection and minor obstacles when riding off-road, but are made of plastic
instead of metal and not suitable for hard knocks.

## Headlight Guard

A headlight guard prevents a rock from smashing your expensive LED headlight (a
    real risk when following other vehicles off-road)

- [Puig Headlight Protector](https://puig.tv/en/tuning-motos/headlight-protector/headlight-protector?bike=23755)
- [AltRider Stainless Steel Mesh Headlight Guard](https://www.altrider.com/altrider-stainless-steel-mesh-headlight-guard-for-the-bmw-f-850-750-gs/pid/2747/cid/2)

## Luggage

### Hard Luggage

Hard luggage is an excellent option for street riding and for parking in places
where locking luggage is required. However, there is a risk of catching a leg
between the luggage and the ground or bike in a crash.

#### Vario Cases

The official Vario cases are plastic cases which can be expanded and shrunk
using an internal lever. This is particularly useful for urban environments-
the side cases can be kept shrunk while riding to enable lane splitting, and
then expanded while parked to accommodate a helmet and riding gear. The cases
can also be coded to use the key on the keyless ignition fob.

The Vario side case mounts are integrated into the bike's tail section, so no
additional racks are required. This keeps the streamlined look of the bike when
the cases are not mounted.

A drawback of the Vario side cases is that they are side-loading instead of
top-loading. This is slightly less convenient to pack and unpack.

- [Vario panniers](https://www.bmw-motorrad-bohling.com/bmw-variosuitcase-set-black-f750gs-2017-2019-f850gs-2017-2019-keyless-ride.html)
- [Vario top case](https://www.bmw-motorrad-bohling.com/bmw-variotopcase-set-f750gs-2017-2019-f850gs-2017-2019-keyless-ride.html)

#### Aftermarket

Various aftermarket luggage systems are available:

- [Hepco-Becker](https://www.advmotorrad.com/Hepco-Becker-Side-Carrier-Rack-F850GS-F750GS-Adventure)
- [Jesse Luggage](https://www.jesseluggage.com/product-category/bmw/bmw-f750gs-f850gs/)
- [SW-MOTECH](https://sw-motech.com/en/products/luggage/side+cases/)
- [TouraTech](https://touratech-usa.com/Motorcycle-Panniers-and-Luggage?a=907)

### Soft Luggage

Soft luggage is an excellent option for off-road riding. The soft material is
unlikely to contribute to injuries in a crash and can pad the bike in a
tip-over.

Various systems are available:

- [Dryspec](https://dryspec.com)
- [Giant Loop](https://www.giantloopmoto.com/)
- [Kriega](https://kriega.us/usdrypacks)
- [Mosko Moto](https://moskomoto.com/collections/motorcycle-luggage)
- [Wolfman](https://wolfmanluggage.com/)

Note that you will need a rack or heatshield to hang a bag over the exhaust
side of the bike to prevent the bag from melting.

### Improvised Luggage

[ROK Straps](http://rokstrapamerica.com/) can be used to strap duffel bags,
drypacks, backpacks and other generic luggage to the tail rack. This can be an
excellent budget option- I find that two ROK straps and a [Sea to
Summit](https://seatosummitusa.com) drypack make an effective luggage option
for well under $80. For a truly budget option (under $35), buy a very
inexpensive drypack from Amazon and line it with a heavy duty garbage bag to
compensate for poor waterproofing.

## Sidestand/Kickstand Foot

A sidestand foot spreads the weight of the bike over a larger area than the OEM
sidestand, which prevents the bike from sinking into soft ground when parked.

- A crushed soda can or hockey puck makes an excellent sidestand foot.
- [Revzilla sells sidestand feet for as low as $5](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle-side-stand-feet)
- [Metal sidestand feet are available on AliExpress for under $10](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32999761042.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.23571245zq4B9v&algo_pvid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c&algo_expid=53c47799-9548-407d-a04c-0c62b564276c-0&btsid=9f609285-a54c-4144-8e96-ee70966496e3&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_4,searchweb201603_52)
- In a pinch, put a flat rock under your sidestand to spread the weight out.

## Seat

- OEM low and comfort seats are available
- [Sargent has multiple seats available](https://www.sargentcycle.com/Seats-Accessories/Sargent-Seats-BMW-F750-850GS/)

## Skid Plate

A skid plate protects the underside of the bike from rocks and debris, and can
be used to slide the bike over obstacles such as tree trunks. Note that 2021
and newer bikes have larger exhaust headers, so plates made for earlier model
years may have fitment issues.

- [Black Dog Cycle Works Ultimate Skid Plate](https://blackdogcw.com/bdcw-ultimate-skid-plate-bmw-f850gsa-f850gs-f750gs/)

## Windshield

A wind deflector such as a [Givi Shield+](http://giviusa.com/givi-products/accessories/s180t-universal-deflector-clear-detail)
can add a bit of height and adjustability to the OEM windshield. Riders of 
average height may find that this aims turbulent air at the middle of their
face.

[MADSTAD](https://madstad.com/collections/bmw/products/bmw-f750-850gs-2018) has
different sizes of windshield available for a range of rider heights. Note that
the side deflectors use the same factory bolt holes as used by a headlight
guard. The optional side deflectors are therefore not compatible with the
F850GSA or an aftermarket headlight guard. Also note that the windshield may
interfere with the rear view mirrors at some heights and angles, so always test
the lock-to-lock steering range after adjusting the windshield.
